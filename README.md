# Calculator_UI_python_PyQt6
This is a Calculator UI written in python  using PyQt6

u can use main.py just don't copy it and say it is yours.
i tried to recreate the windows 10 calculator.


you can add functions by creatring a folder named 'functions' and then in there a file named 'functions.py'

hope that helps have much fun.
